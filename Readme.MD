# WooCommerce Customers Also Viewed

A simple plugin built for WordPress that allows the website owner to integrate a section showing products that have been viewed by other users that have viewed the current product. 

The owner can choose the location of the 'Customers Also Viewed' box, or use the new `[customers-also-viewed]` shortcode within the loop to fully customise the location.
